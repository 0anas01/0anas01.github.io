It sucks when companies fail to communicate whether a candidate is advancing, delayed, or rejected, even after follow-up emails. I’m talking especially about the roles the candidate interviewed for.

The silence creates cognitive friction. You don’t know whether to move on or wait. The emotional toll compounds with each day, made worse by well-meaning inquiries from friends and family. The whole experience begins to feel less like a professional process and more like a test of endurance.

Some might argue HR is waiting for feedback from interviewers and doesn’t yet have an answer. Fair enough. But even then, why not send a placeholder update? “We’re still processing interviews. Expect an update by [date].” That takes 30 seconds, but makes a huge difference.

I think this is more of a systemic indifference. Most hiring pipelines aren't designed with candidate experience in mind. But they should be. The way you treat people during the hiring process reflects your internal culture. If communication is disjointed, timelines unclear, and feedback absent, what message does that send about how your teams operate?

One thing I believe can work is building SLAs into hiring. Set a policy to update every interviewed candidate within a fixed number of days, even if it's to say there’s no update. Automate it if needed. Silence shouldn't be the default.

Know that uncertainty paralyzes people. Better hiring systems benefit everyone, both the candidates and the companies.
